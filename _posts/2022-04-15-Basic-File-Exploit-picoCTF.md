> **Challenge Description**
> The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

> Connect to the program with netcat: $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681
> The program’s source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/543/program-redacted.c).

> **Hint** > _Try passing in things the program doesn’t expect. Like string instead of a number._

When we first run the program we get this prompt.

Doing what the hint suggest by passing in strings instead of a number we get this error.

Judging from this output we now know that the program has some kind of input checking feature. Which we can break the conditions in this feature.

But first I tried to follow its instructions to see where it would lead. When I typed 1 it asked me to enter data to write to a file and the program then assigns a entry number to the written data.

No luck! Even if I tried to pass in large amounts of input.

The challege provided the source code for use to analyze. [Sorce Code](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/543/program-redacted.c) From analyzing the `main()` function, it seems that when the user types the 1 the `data_write()` function is invoked. Additionally, if the user types 2 the `data_read()` function is invoked.

The next thing I did was to checking the `data_write()` function to see if their are limitations to this program like limited number of inputs, limited number of conditions or condition where i can invoke the flag.

From the code you can see that a variable char input[100] has a limited `number(100)` of characters that can be stored in this array.

At first this could be a vulnerability to be exploited, but previously I tried this when I typed 1 and created a data entry of random number and found no lead on the flag.

So I moved on and looked at the `data_read()` function.

From the code you can see that the flag keyword is passed in the `puts()` method and this can be called if the specific condition is met.

Notice the `char entry[4]` variable, entry argument in the if statement above and the `r = tgetinput(entry, 4)` variable. This tells us that the entry can only have 4 character in it which can cause a problem if a number say 10,000 entries have been created.

With haste I invoked the `data_write()` function to create a data entry of >100 characters and when it prompted my to give length of the data I created I typed 101 which is greater than the `char input[100]` variable can store.

Then in the Please enter the entry number of your data I typed a string(Give me the flag) instead of a number as I remembered the hint.

Finally, the flag has been found
