# Recommendations {#7k5239gycfkv}

To empower mothers as home-based English teachers while accommodating their scheduling constraints and building their confidence, we recommend a blended training model that integrates brief, mobile-accessible microlearning modules with periodic synchronous coaching. The microlearning units—3–5 minute videos, audio guides, and printable activity sheets—deliver focused instruction on interactive techniques such as dialogic reading and parental expansions, and can be accessed anytime mothers have a moment. These asynchronous lessons are complemented by live coaching sessions (via small-group video calls or community meet-ups) in which mothers practice new strategies, receive individualized feedback, and observe peer modeling to reinforce self-efficacy. Printable, low-tech resources ensure inclusivity for families with limited internet access. This approach is grounded in evidence that combining digital, self-guided parent training with live support enhances accessibility, completion rates, and equity (Grodberg & Smith, 2022), and that dialogic reading paired with parental expansion techniques significantly boosts late-talkers' expressive skills by increasing parental contingency during shared reading (Suttora et al., 2021).
