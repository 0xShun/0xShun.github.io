# Solution
Let's take a look at some basic information about the file

```bash
file guess_the_password 

guess_the_password: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=4b5316bbef627d72efaa8d38723b2e9725065ec2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

It's a 64 bit ELF file. It's not stripped so we can see most of the original logic.

Looking at the main function we can see that it's using the `check` function to validate the input.

Going forward, ghidra would be a useful tool to quickly identify the code.

Looking at the `check` function in ghidra we get this:

Looking at the condition. It checks for three things
1. If the length of the input is 10
2. If the first character in the input is 1
3. if the 5th index is 9

With this we can try the input `1999999999`

We get the correct password.
